# Stunt Island at 800% detail

(aka “Ace got glasses”)

This is a mod for Stunt Island, creating a copy of the game where the engine
works as if the detail level were set at 800%. The “Detail” slider in the
preferences is ignored; all other preferences work as normal.

Version 1.0 (11.11.2024). Made by Alberto.

## To use

* Copy `si-8x` (Linux) or `si-8x.exe` (Windows) into your Stunt Island
  directory (where STUNT.EXE and MAKEONE.EXE are located).
* Launch it.
* The files STUNTS1.EXE, MAKEONE1.EXE and PLAYONE1.EXE should appear.

Alternatively, you can start the program from a terminal, in which case you can
provide the location of your Stunt Island directory as parameter.

## Supported versions

You can check whether your version is supported by looking at the size of
STUNTS.EXE. The mod supports currently these versions:

* 137240 Bytes (GOG version; the one by Steam should be identical)
* 134784 Bytes (created by the “P3 - Final Patch Set” provided by
                www.planetmic.com/stunt)
